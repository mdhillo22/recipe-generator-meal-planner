\# Prompt Usage Notes (Cursor) — Recipe Generator \& Meal Planner



We used Cursor as our AI collaborator to design, implement, and document this mini project.



\## Prompts archived in this folder

\- design\_prompts.md — used to plan architecture, data flow, UI layout, and data structures

\- coding\_prompts.md — used to generate the FastAPI backend, frontend JavaScript logic, and nutrition estimation function

\- documentation\_prompts.md — used to draft the README and API documentation



\## How prompts were used

1\) We started with the design prompts to determine what user inputs the UI should collect and what outputs should be generated.

2\) We used the coding prompts to scaffold FastAPI endpoints and connect the client interface to the backend.

3\) We created prompt templates for recipe generation and meal plan generation using Together.ai, requesting structured JSON output.

4\) We used documentation prompts to produce the README and supporting write-ups.
